# Final Project for ROBOCON: Autonomous Robot with Advanced Controls

This project is the culmination of creativity, robotics, and software engineering, designed to showcase the versatility and power of autonomous robots. Our robot, resembling a sleek vacuum cleaner in a disc shape, is equipped with sophisticated sensors and control systems for efficient operation. Powered by ROS2 Humble and modeled in Gazebo, the robot is capable of performing dynamic tasks with precision and adaptability.

The project begins with the creation of a launch file, carefully crafted to initialize the environment, spawn the robot, and configure various sensors and actuators. The robot's sensors—ranging from cameras to proximity sensors—feed data back to RViz, allowing us to visualize the robot's surroundings in real-time, ensuring optimal performance.

Through the integration of PID controllers and various modes such as semi-auto and joystick control, the robot can navigate autonomously and respond to different situations with fluidity and accuracy. The custom URDF model, designed specifically for this project, mimics the appearance and functionality of a vacuum cleaner, making it not only a technological feat but also an aesthetic and innovative machine.

With keyboard and joystick-based control modes, users can interact with the robot, making it ideal for tasks requiring human intervention while still maintaining autonomous behavior. Additionally, camera-based controls allow for further precision in task execution, ensuring a seamless user experience.

By uploading the project's code to a private GitHub repository, we ensure a collaborative and transparent approach, where the development process is documented and shared for future enhancements and open-source contributions.

This project represents the convergence of theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience, paving the way for more advanced and efficient robotic systems in the future.
